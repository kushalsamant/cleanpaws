  <h1>Clean Paws</h1>

  <p>
    If you walk your dog daily, you already know the problem.
    Mud, dust, and dirty paws come straight into your home after every walk.
  </p>

  <p>
    Floors get dirty. Sofas get messy. Beds get muddy.
    Washing paws in the bathroom every time is inconvenient and stressful for both you and your dog.
  </p>

  <h2>A simple after-walk routine</h2>

  <p>
    A dog paw cleaner cup lets you clean your dog’s paws gently in seconds.
    Just add a little water, insert the paw, twist, and wipe dry.
  </p>

  <p>
    No running water. No splashing. No chasing your dog around the house.
  </p>
