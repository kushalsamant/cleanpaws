# Clean Paws

If you walk your dog daily, you already know the problem.  
Mud, dust, and dirty paws come straight into your home after every walk.

Floors get dirty. Sofas get messy. Beds get muddy.  
Washing paws in the bathroom every time is inconvenient and stressful for both you and your dog.

## A simple after-walk routine

A dog paw cleaner cup lets you clean your dog’s paws gently in seconds.  
Just add a little water, insert the paw, twist, and wipe dry.

No running water. No splashing. No chasing your dog around the house.
